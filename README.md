<h1 align="start">About</h1>

The purpose of the application is to play videos using Media3 ExoPlayer, providing a smooth and reliable playback experience. It includes essential controls for media playback and supports various video formats.

The project was somewhat challenging since I had never worked directly with Media3 ExoPlayer and some of the other tools used, but I believe I made the best decisions. I didn't invest a lot in architecture design, since this project's goal was to learn how to use the library and understand how media playback works. I also don't have much expertise in UI/UX, but I aimed to make the interface as intuitive and visually appealing as possible.
